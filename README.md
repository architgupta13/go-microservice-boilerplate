## Go Microservice Boilerplate

Creating microservices is a new "Hello World" program
in the process of learning a language. Writing an HTTP
API endpoint, connecting to a database, structuring
project files and containerizing the web application
are a few essential things that serve as minimum useful
proficiency on a programming language.

The aim of this project is to help accelerate the process
for people learning Golang/Go.
